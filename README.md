# ETA Destination Arrival time  

In this project, we will try to guess Estimated Arrival time

**Currently, we will use provided data. and findout what kind of more data we want for our ML model**

- We have break data into segments, so we can understand data which is provided. 
- We will apply different algorithm in different segments. and will findout which algorithm is good for our model in both terms like computation and duration.


Our data is in **raw-data** folder.   
Jupyter notebook sheet is available in **notebooks** folder.
